# MNIST Application.


In this application we are using NeuroTorch to classify the MNIST dataset or the Fashion-MNIST dataset. In the folder 
you can find the jupyter notebook [tutorial.ipynb](tutorial.ipynb) which contains a simple tutorial on how to use 
NeuroTorch for image classification.

For the one who want more statistical information about the dynamics of NeuroTorch on classification task, see 
the repository containing the [mnist project](https://github.com/NeuroTorch/MnistClassification_NeuroTorch) where you
can run the [results generation script](https://github.com/NeuroTorch/MnistClassification_NeuroTorch/results_generation.py) 
which will generate a file with the results of the
trainings and the testings with different models and different parameters. Note that this script can take a while to
run.

In the first place, whether you want to run the tutorial or the entire analysis, you will want to install the 
dependencies.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/JeremieGince/PythonBasicTools
pip install git+https://github.com/NeuroTorch/NeuroTorch
pip install -r mnist_requirements.txt
