# MNIST Application.


In this application we are using NeuroTorch to classify the MNIST dataset or the Fashion-MNIST dataset. In the folder 
you can find the jupyter notebook [tutoriel.ipynb](tutoriel.ipynb) which contains a simple tutorial on how to use NeuroTorch
for image classification.

For the one who want more statistical information about the dynamics of NeuroTorch on classification task, you
can run the [results generation script](results_generation.py) which will generate a file with the results of the
trainings and the testings with different models and different parameters. Note that this script can take a while to
run.

In the first place, whether you want to run the tutoriel or the entire analysis, you will want to install the 
dependencies.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/JeremieGince/NeuroTorch.git
pip install mnist_requirements.txt
```
